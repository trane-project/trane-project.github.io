# Welcome to the Trane Tour

Trane is an automated practice system for the acquisition of complex and highly hierarchical skills.
It is based on the principles of spaced repetition, mastery learning, and chunking. 

Trane is named after John Coltrane, whose nickname Trane was often used in wordplay with the word
train (as in the vehicle) to describe the overwhelming power of his playing. It is used here as a
play on its homophone (as in "*trane* a new skill").

During this tour, we'll break down what all the words in the first paragraph mean and get you
started with using Trane.
