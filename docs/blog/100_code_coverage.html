<p>As of commit <a href="https://github.com/trane-project/trane/commit/aa3536d0a1db3ff64679d70eae905cc4854ef068">aa3536d0</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/trane-project/trane">Trane</a> can boast a code coverage score of 100%. I had
difficulty finding a comprehensive guide when I was getting started, so this post is meant to
explain how I got there, the tools I used, the problems I ran into, and the lessons I learned.
Hopefully this will save time to someone else who is trying to add test coverage to a Rust project.</p>
<h2 id="the-tools"><a class="header" href="#the-tools">The Tools</a></h2>
<p>I used <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/grcov">grcov</a> to generate the coverage information. This requires
that the tests are run in the nightly version of Rust with special flags that create the
coverage information. I used the <a href="https://github.com/rraval/actions-rs-grcov">grcov</a> GitHub Action
to generate the report. This is a fork of the original repository, which appears to be abandoned.
The fork is needed to support excluding lines from the coverage report (more on that later).</p>
<p>For comparing the coverage reports I used <a href="https://coveralls.io/">Coveralls</a>. This is a free service
for open-source repositories that provides a web interface for comparing the reports between
commits. Here's the <a href="https://coveralls.io/builds/53511903">example report</a> of the commit mentioned
above. I used the official Coveralls GitHub Action to upload the report to the service.</p>
<p>Here are the configuration files for reference:</p>
<ul>
<li>The file to set up all the GitHub actions:
<a href="https://github.com/trane-project/trane/blob/master/.github/workflows/coverage.yaml">coverage.yaml</a></li>
<li>The file to configure grcov:
<a href="https://github.com/trane-project/trane/blob/master/.github/actions-rs/grcov.yml">grcov.yml</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="configuring-grcov"><a class="header" href="#configuring-grcov">Configuring grcov</a></h3>
<p>I ran into multiple issues with grcov which required some configuration to work around them.</p>
<ul>
<li>The initial report included coverage information for all the dependencies. Figuring out the fix
for this issue took me a while, but I fixed by setting the <code>ignore</code> option in the configuration
file to exclude any directory with <code>.cargo</code> in its path.</li>
<li>The initial reports included branch coverage information. I decided to stick initially to line
coverage, as I could not get it working with the fix to the previous issue. This required that I
set the <code>branch</code> option to <code>false</code> in the configuration file. I might revisit this decision later
and try to get branch coverage working.</li>
<li>Some lines were marked as not covered, even though they don't contain actual code. They are
ignored by setting the <code>excl-line</code> in the configuration file.
<ul>
<li>Some files have the first line marked as not covered. All my files have module-level comments,
so I fixed the issue by excluding all lines that start with <code>//!</code> from the coverage report.</li>
<li><code>#[derive...</code> lines are marked as not covered. This is because the code generated by those
macros is not covered. Given that I trust the compiler to generate the correct code, I decided
to ignore those lines.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="other-issues"><a class="header" href="#other-issues">Other issues</a></h3>
<p>I ran into an issue in which fields in a struct or some variants of an enum would appear as not
covered in the Coveralls report. This is related to the issue with <code>#[derive...]</code> lines. In
particular, if a type implements the <code>Clone</code> trait, but the struct or some variant of an enum is not
cloned anywhere in the code, some fields will appear as not covered. The fix is to remove the
<code>Clone</code> trait if you are not using it or add tests that clone the type if it's an enum and not all
variants are cloned in the code.</p>
<p>Some other issues with partial hits using grcov and Rust have been reported. See this
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/grcov/issues/476">issue</a> for more details.</p>
<p>There's also the problem that grcov does not appear to be maintained at the moment, apart from
automated commits updating its dependencies. I do not know whether the software has been abandoned
or is mostly complete at this point. However, issues have not been addressed in a while, which would
indicate that the latter option is more likely.</p>
<h2 id="getting-to-100-code-coverage"><a class="header" href="#getting-to-100-code-coverage">Getting to 100% Code Coverage</a></h2>
<p>In this section, I will go over some of the steps I took to get to 100% code coverage. The first
step was configuring grcov to exclude any arbitrary line or section from the coverage report. This
is done in two steps.</p>
<p>The first step was to modify the configuration file to exclude any line with the <code>grcov-excl-line</code>
string from the final results. This allows me to exclude lines that are hard to test or not very
relevant from the coverage report. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The modules that use SQLite call a method to prepare a statement. This is a fallible
operation, but this particular line will never fail because the statement does not change. If a
bad change to the statement were introduced, the tests would fail anyway. Here's an example
from the <code>practice_stats</code> module, which stores the results of the user's practice sessions:
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>// Retrieve the exercise trials from the database.
let connection = self.pool.get()?;
let mut stmt = connection
    .prepare_cached(
        "SELECT score, timestamp from practice_stats WHERE unit_uid = (
          SELECT unit_uid FROM uids WHERE unit_id = ?1)
          ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT ?2;",
    )
    .with_context(|| "cannot prepare statement")?; //grcov-excl-line
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
</li>
<li>Adding an entry to the search index is also a fallible operation, but there are already tests
that verify that search work, so there's little value in having a test that triggers this
error. This is the code from the <code>course_library</code> module, which opens the courses stored in
the file system for use with Trane:
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>  // Add the lesson manifest to the search index.
  Self::add_to_index_writer(
      index_writer,
      lesson_manifest.id,
      &amp;lesson_manifest.name,
      &amp;lesson_manifest.description,
      &amp;lesson_manifest.metadata,
  )?; // grcov-excl-line
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The second step was to configure grcov to exclude entire sections of code from the report. For
example, the <code>Trane</code> struct that is the main entry point for the library reimplements all the
interfaces so that users do not have to access the fields of the struct to call those methods. Thus,
those lines appeared as uncovered in the report but are actually covered by the all the other tests.
I fixed this by configuring the <code>excl-start</code> and <code>excl-stop</code> options to exclude sections of the code
from the final report. Here's an example of some of the code that was excluded:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>impl ReviewList for Trane {
    fn add_to_review_list(&amp;mut self, unit_id: &amp;Ustr) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {
        self.review_list.write().add_to_review_list(unit_id)
    }

    fn remove_from_review_list(&amp;mut self, unit_id: &amp;Ustr) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {
        self.review_list.write().remove_from_review_list(unit_id)
    }

    fn all_review_list_entries(&amp;self) -&gt; Result&lt;Vec&lt;Ustr&gt;&gt; {
        self.review_list.read().all_review_list_entries()
    }
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Once those two steps were configured, the coverage was around 90%. The remaining 10% consisted of
edge cases that had not been tested yet. For example, there was no test to ensure that trying to
open a Trane library with an invalid path would fail. Below is a list of example commits that
introduce additional tests to cover those edge cases:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/trane-project/trane/commit/b9ea4c02a414da9fcdddc69e4abfa450a7c06817">Improve code coverage for scheduler
module.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/trane-project/trane/commit/0a34aa37f49a15f95f712c59786a5c2591a2d7f8">Improve code coverage for graph
module.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/trane-project/trane/commit/1af5fc520760ca4a5b4b8f6f820802ac6143eee5">Improve code coverage of <code>course_builder</code>
module.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There are about a dozen more commits that gradually took the coverage to 100%. Finally, the commit
linked at the top of the post was the first one to reach 100% code coverage. This commit adds a test
to verify that the score cache does not return a score for courses that have all of its lessons
added to the blacklist.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a class="header" href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>The effort to get to 100% code coverage was not very time-consuming and uncovered some minor bugs
that had gone unnoticed. However, the core of the logic was already covered by existing tests and
none of the bugs that were uncovered were critical. Still, I think the effort has given me more
confidence to make changes to the code base without worrying about introducing new bugs or modifying
existing behavior.</p>
