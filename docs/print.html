<p><img src="./coltrane.jpg" alt="John Coltrane" /></p>
<p>Trane is an automated learning system for the acquisition of complex and highly hierarchical skills.
It is based on the principles of spaced repetition, mastery learning, and chunking.</p>
<p>Given a set of exercises which have been bundled into lessons and further bundled in courses, as
well as the dependency relationships between those lessons and courses, Trane selects exercises to
present to the user. It makes sure that exercises from a course or lesson are not presented until
the exercises in their dependencies have been sufficiently mastered. It also tries to keep the
difficulty of the exercises balanced, so that the selected exercises lie slightly outside the user's
current abilities.</p>
<p>You can think of this process as progressing through the skill tree of a character in a video game,
but applied to arbitrary skills, specified in plain-text files which are easy to share and augment.</p>
<p>Trane is named after John Coltrane, whose nickname Trane was often used in wordplay with the word
train (as in the vehicle) to describe the overwhelming power of his playing. It is used here as a
play on its homophone (as in &quot;<em>trane</em> a new skill&quot;).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="concepts"><a class="header" href="#concepts">Concepts</a></h1>
<p>This section defines basic concepts used in Trane, useful both for using it and for creating new
material.</p>
<h2 id="mastery-score"><a class="header" href="#mastery-score">Mastery Score.</a></h2>
<p>When presented an exercise, a user performs it and assigns it a score signifying their mastery of
the task. The scores range from one to five, with one meaning the skill is just being introduced
(e.g. reading a section of a music score and figuring out the notes and movements required to play
it) and five meaning complete mastery of the material (e.g. effortlessly playing the section and
improvising on it).</p>
<h2 id="units"><a class="header" href="#units">Units</a></h2>
<p>There are three types of units in Trane:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exercise: An exercise is just a task that needs to be performed and assigned a score.</li>
<li>Lesson: A set of related exercises, which ideally follow the same format.</li>
<li>Course: A set of lessons on a related topic.</li>
</ul>
<p>A Trane library is a set of courses stored under the same directory. Trane stores its configuration
under a directory called <code>.trane</code> in that directory. Users might want to have multiple separate
libraries if they are learning separate skills (e.g. music and chess), and they want to keep their
practice separate.</p>
<p>Units are defined in JSON files called manifests, which are serialized versions of structs defined
in the data module. The ID, name, description, locations of any external files (e.g. the files
storing the front and back of a flashcard), etc., are defined in those files.</p>
<h2 id="blacklist"><a class="header" href="#blacklist">Blacklist</a></h2>
<p>Each Trane library has a blacklist. A unit in a blacklist can be any exercise, lesson, or course. If
a unit is in the blacklist, Trane will not show any exercises from it. If a lesson or course depend
on a blacklisted unit, the scheduling algorithm will act as if the blacklisted unit has been
mastered.</p>
<p>A unit should be added to the blacklist if the user already has mastered the material (e.g. an
accomplished musician will want to skip the course teaching the notes in the major scale) or if they
have no interest in learning the material (e.g. someone interested in learning the guitar might want
to skip units which are focused on another instrument).</p>
<h2 id="filters"><a class="header" href="#filters">Filters</a></h2>
<p>In its normal mode of operation, Trane looks for exercises in the entire library. There are times
when users might want to focus on a smaller section. Filters provide users with the ability to
select specific exercises. There are three types of filters.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lesson filter: Only present exercises from the given lesson. For example, users might want to only
practice exercises from a lesson covering a section of a song.</li>
<li>Course filter: Only present exercises from the given course. The dependency relationships among
the lessons in the course are respected. For example, users might want to only practice exercises
from a course covering an entire song.</li>
<li>Metadata filter: Courses and lessons can have key-value pairs as metadata. A metadata filter acts
on this metadata to present exercises exclusively from units which match the filter, while also
preserving the dependency relationships between those lessons. Lessons which do not pass the
filter are considered as mastered so that the scheduler can continue the search. For example, a
user might want to only practice exercises from lessons and courses for the guitar and in a
specific key.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="theory"><a class="header" href="#theory">Theory</a></h1>
<h2 id="spaced-repetition"><a class="header" href="#spaced-repetition">Spaced Repetition</a></h2>
<p>Spaced repetition is a long-established way to efficiently memorize new information and to transfer
that information to long-term memory. Trane applies spaced repetition to exercises that require
memorization (e.g. recalling the notes in the chord A7) and to those which require mastery of an
action (e.g. playing a section of a song). </p>
<p>The space repetition algorithm in Trane is fairly simple and relies on computing a score for a given
exercise based on previous trials rather than computing the optimal time at which the exercise needs
to be presented again. This will most likely result in exercises being presented more often than
they would in other spaced repetition software. Trane is not focused on memorization but on the
repetition of individual skills until they are mastered, so I do not believe this to be a problem.</p>
<h2 id="mastery-learning"><a class="header" href="#mastery-learning">Mastery Learning</a></h2>
<p>Mastery learning states that students must achieve a level of mastery in a skill before moving on to
learning the skills which depend on the current skill.</p>
<p>Trane applies mastery learning by preventing the user from moving on to the dependents of a unit
until the material in the unit is sufficiently mastered. It also excludes units whose dependencies
have not been fully met. Otherwise, a user might be presented with material that lies too outside
their current abilities and become frustrated. If a user's performance on a previously mastered unit
degrades, Trane will make the user practice the material until it is mastered again.</p>
<h2 id="chunking"><a class="header" href="#chunking">Chunking</a></h2>
<p>Chunking consists of breaking up a complex skill into smaller components that can be practiced
independently.</p>
<p>Trane applies chunking by allowing users to define lessons and courses with arbitrary dependency
relationships. For example, learning to improvise over chord progressions might be broken into units
to learn the notes in each chord, learn the fingerings of each chord, or improvise over single
chords. The user can then define a unit that exercises the union of all the previous skills and
claim the other lessons as a dependency.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="vision"><a class="header" href="#vision">Vision</a></h1>
<p>Trane aims to offer a coherent and powerful user experience that is capable of taking students of
any level and allowing them to make the most out of their practice sessions, as well as offering
features to allow teachers to track and guide the progress of their students. Trane will attempt to
fulfil those goals by making progress along main four axes. Those are described below using
musical training as an example, but any skill for which the proper exercises and the dependencies
among them can be derived should be an apt candidate for Trane.</p>
<h2 id="defining-arbitrary-skill-graphs"><a class="header" href="#defining-arbitrary-skill-graphs">Defining arbitrary skill graphs</a></h2>
<p>Complex skills are in fact a complex network of simpler skills and domain knowledge that have been
acquired after many years of practice. Experts on a field might not be consciously aware of the full
network, either because some of it is the result of unconscious processes or because it was learned
in early childhood or in an unstructured manner. Trane's first goal is to allow this graph to be
defined and reused for the purpose of teaching other people.</p>
<p>To succeed at this task, Trane must be able to handle a large set of exercises as well as their
dependencies in a way that allows users to define arbitrary relationships between them, to
seamlessly combine exercises from multiple sources, and to provide primitives to select particular
sections of the graph to focus on or to ignore during practice sessions.</p>
<p>As an example, the skill of playing a large musical piece depends on the skills of playing each
movement, which in turn depend on skills to play each passage. By defining the practice of the piece
on this manner, the student is first asked to master individual passages, then individual movements,
and eventually the entire piece.</p>
<h2 id="automated-and-guided-progress"><a class="header" href="#automated-and-guided-progress">Automated and guided progress</a></h2>
<p>Having defined an extensive skill graph, students should be able to take advantage of it without
lots of effort or planning. In its default mode, Trane provides exercises to the user that gradually
introduce students to new skills and reinforce the ones already in the process of being mastered.
Trane also takes care of keeping the difficulty of the exercise balanced so only a small percentage
of very hard and very easy questions are shown. In doing so, Trane ensures that the student is
slightly challenged without falling into any extreme of frustration or boredom.</p>
<p>Trane's main mechanism for guiding progress is to allow students to rate the mastery of each trial
of an exercise. Trane uses the past scores to decide which exercises to show, when to stop
traversing the dependency graph, how often to show an exercise, and how to balance the difficulty of
each batch of exercises.</p>
<p>In combination with its abilities to handle large graphs of dependency relationships, Trane also
allows students to focus on specific courses, lessons, or on material that matches specific
metadata, while still keeping the guarantees mentioned above. For example, a student could choose to
focus on exercises made for the guitar while Trane still makes sure that harder guitar exercises are
not shown to the student until easier guitar exercises are sufficiently mastered.</p>
<h2 id="plain-text-configuration-files-for-easy-sharing-and-collaboration"><a class="header" href="#plain-text-configuration-files-for-easy-sharing-and-collaboration">Plain text configuration files for easy sharing and collaboration</a></h2>
<p>The task of defining the dependency graphs for a skill is impossible for a beginner to undertake
because they lack the experience needed to understand the full picture. It is also difficult for
teachers because the task is big, and they might lack the technical knowledge to do it. However, one
of Trane's assumptions is that the majority of learners will follow the same path to mastering a
skill, so the task of defining the graph needs to be undertaken once.</p>
<p>To make collaboration and sharing easier, Trane provides a simple text file format for defining the
exercises, lessons, and courses and their relationships. This allows these files to be automatically
generated and managed in version control software. Trane also provides utilities that make it easier
to generate these files and to verify the generated output.</p>
<p>By allowing the generation of these files, one could define a course that asks a student to perform
some exercises in each key without the burden of manually defining the files for each key. And by
allowing these files to version controlled, it is our hope that students can easily get started by
taking advantage of official courses and those created by the community.</p>
<h2 id="integration-with-teachers-materials-and-feedback"><a class="header" href="#integration-with-teachers-materials-and-feedback">Integration with teachers materials and feedback</a></h2>
<p><em>Note: Most of the ideas in this section are not yet implemented.</em></p>
<p>Another of Trane's goals is to integrate teachers into the process. The first way Trane achieves
this is by letting them integrate their own materials with existing materials. For example, a
teacher could add additional exercises to a lesson, or add new courses that depend on existing ones.</p>
<p>Another way is to let teachers provide feedback on the progress of students. While these ideas are
not yet implemented, the goal is to allow teachers to rate the mastery of their students in a given
exercise and have Trane adjust how it schedules the exercises accordingly. Students should also be
able to make a note of which exercises they need to review with their teachers during their next
session.</p>
<p>Using the earlier example of performing a large musical piece, a teacher could ask the student to
perform some exercises in front of them and give them a score, which might be different from the
student's self-assessment. Teacher and student could also go through the list of exercises the
student flagged for review as the teacher provides notes on the finer points of performing the
piece.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="using-trane"><a class="header" href="#using-trane">Using Trane</a></h1>

<p><a href="https://github.com/trane-project/trane">trane</a> is the core library responsible for opening and
interacting with Trane courses. It also includes the data formats for Trane and the utilities to
build new courses.</p>
<p>Other applications are free to integrate Trane in their own ways. For example, a fighting video game
could integrate Trane into their tutorial mode to allow players to efficiently practice their skills
and make automatic progress in mastering all the game's mechanics.</p>
<p>This library contains utilities to make it easier to write Trane courses. Refer to the section

<p><a href="https://github.com/trane-project/trane-cli">trane-cli</a> is the command-line interface for Trane.</p>
<h2 id="installation-instructions"><a class="header" href="#installation-instructions">Installation instructions</a></h2>
<p>Github releases include a compiled binary. Download the one for your OS and architecture and put it
somewhere where you and/or your shell can find it. There are releases for Linux, Windows, and Mac.
Releases for ARM OS X are not available at the moment because cross-compilation is not working.</p>
<h2 id="build-instructions"><a class="header" href="#build-instructions">Build instructions</a></h2>
<p>You can also build <code>trane-cli</code> from source. The only requirement is an installation of the stable
Rust tool chain. Running <code>cargo build</code> from the repository's root should do the job.</p>
<p>You can also run <code>cargo install</code> to install the binary in the cargo bin directory.</p>
<h2 id="starting-guide"><a class="header" href="#starting-guide">Starting guide</a></h2>
<h3 id="running-the-command"><a class="header" href="#running-the-command">Running the command</a></h3>
<p>To start the binary call <code>trane</code>, if you installed it, or <code>cargo run</code> from the repo's root
directory. As of now, the command line does not take any arguments. Once you start the CLI, you will
be met with a prompt.</p>
<pre><code>trane &gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Entering enter executes the input command. Pressing CTRL-C cancels the command. Pressing CTRL-D
sends an EOF signal to break out of the line reading loop.</p>
<h3 id="entering-your-first-command"><a class="header" href="#entering-your-first-command">Entering your first command</a></h3>
<p>To see the next exercise, enter (prompt not shown for brevity) <code>trane next</code>.</p>
<p>Internally, the <code>clap</code> library is being used to process the input. This requires that a command name
is present, even though it's redundant because this CLI can only run one command. For this reason,
<code>trane-cli</code> automatically prepends the command <code>trane</code> if it's not there already. So all commands
can be run without the need for adding <code>trane</code> to the beginning.</p>
<h3 id="opening-a-course-library"><a class="header" href="#opening-a-course-library">Opening a course library</a></h3>
<p>The previous command returns an error because Trane has not opened a course library. A course
library is a set of courses under a directory containing a subdirectory named <code>.trane/</code>. Inside this
subdirectory, Trane stores the results of previous exercises, blacklists, and saved filters. This
directory is created automatically.</p>
<p>Let's suppose you have downloaded the <a href="https://github.com/trane-project/trane-music">trane-music</a>
and called Trane inside that directory. Then, you can type <code>open ./</code> to load all the library under
that directory.</p>
<h3 id="your-first-study-session"><a class="header" href="#your-first-study-session">Your first study session</a></h3>
<p>If all the courses are valid, the operation will succeed. Now you can run the next command. Your
first exercise should be shown.</p>
<pre><code>trane &gt;&gt; next
Course ID: trane::music::guitar::basic_fretboard
Lesson ID: trane::music::guitar::basic_fretboard::lesson_1
Exercise ID: trane::music::guitar::basic_fretboard::lesson_1::exercise_7

Find the note G in the fretboard at a slow tempo without a metronome.
</code></pre>
<p>If you are unsure on what to do, you can try looking at the instructions for this lesson by
running the <code>instructions lesson</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>trane &gt;&gt; instructions lesson
Go down each string and find the given note in the first twelve frets.
Repeat but this time going up the strings.

Do this at a slow tempo but without a metronome.
</code></pre>
<p>Lessons and courses can also include accompanying material. For example, a lesson on the major scale
could include material defining the major scale, and it's basic intervals for reference. This course
does not contain any material. For those lessons or courses which do, you can display it with the
<code>material lesson</code> and <code>material course</code> commands respectively.</p>
<p>So this exercise belongs to a course teaching the positions of the notes in the guitar fretboard,
and it is asking us to go up and down the strings to find the note. Once you have given the exercise
a try, you can set your score. There are no objective definitions of which score means but the main
difference between them is the degree of unconscious mastery over the exercise. A score of one means
you are just learning the position of the note, you still make mistakes, and have to commit
conscious effort to the task. A score of five would mean you don't even have to think about the task
because it has thoroughly soaked through all the various pathways involved in learning.</p>
<p>Let say we give it a score of two out of five. You can do so by entering <code>score 2</code>. Let's assume
that you also want to verify your answer. If there's an answer associated with the current exercise,
you can show it by running the <code>answer</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>trane &gt;&gt; answer
Course ID: trane::music::guitar::basic_fretboard
Lesson ID: trane::music::guitar::basic_fretboard::lesson_1
Exercise ID: trane::music::guitar::basic_fretboard::lesson_1::exercise_7

Answer:

- 1st string (high E): 3rd fret
- 2nd string (B): 8th fret
- 3rd string (G): 12th fret
- 4th string (D): 5th fret
- 5th string (A): 10th fret
- 6th string (low E): 3rd fret
</code></pre>
<p>To show the current exercise again, you can use the <code>current</code> command. Now it's time to move onto
the next question. Questions are presented in the order Trane schedules them and as you master the
exercises you automatically unlock new lessons and courses.</p>
<h3 id="short-reference-for-other-commands"><a class="header" href="#short-reference-for-other-commands">Short reference for other commands.</a></h3>
<p>At its simplest, the previous commands cover much of the most common operations. The documentation
(accessed with the <code>help</code> or <code>&lt;COMMAND&gt; --help</code> commands) is pretty much self-explanatory for most
other commands.</p>
<pre><code>trane &gt;&gt; help

</code></pre>
<p>There are however, some details which warrant further explanation.</p>
<p>The <code>filter metadata</code> command allows you to define simple metadata filters. For example, to only
show exercises for the major scale in the key of C, you can type:</p>
<pre><code>trane &gt;&gt; filter metadata --course-metadata scale_type:major --lesson-metadata key:C
Set the unit filter to only show exercises with the given metadata
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>filter set-saved</code> command allows you to user more complex filters by storing the definition of
the filter inside the <code>.trane/filters</code> directory. For now, a filter can be created by serializing a
struct of type <code>NamedFilter</code> into a JSON file (see the file <code>src/data/filter.rs</code> inside the Trane
repo for more details). You can refer to those filters by a unique ID in their file, which can be
also shown by running the <code>filter list-saved</code> command.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="trane-app"><a class="header" href="#trane-app">trane-app</a></h1>
<p><strong>UPCOMING:</strong> trane-app is a graphic interface for Trane. It is currently under construction.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="trane-server"><a class="header" href="#trane-server">trane-server</a></h1>
<p><strong>UPCOMING:</strong> trane-server is a server for Trane to allow other applications to use Trane without
requiring the use of Rust or for applications incompatible with the GPLv3 License. It is currently
under construction.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="writing-trane-courses"><a class="header" href="#writing-trane-courses">Writing Trane Courses</a></h1>
<p>Trane courses have the following directory structure:</p>
<pre><code>course_root/
    course_manifest.json
    &lt;LESSON_DIR&gt;/
        lesson_manifest.json
        &lt;EXERCISE_DIR&gt;/
            exercise_manifest.json
</code></pre>
<p>There can be multiple lessons in a course and multiple exercises in a lesson. In addition, there can
be asset files (e.g. markdown files) anywhere in the course directory, but it's best to put each of
them in the same directory as the manifest that refers to it.</p>
<p>So writing a course for Trane consists of generating the manifest files in this directory structure
and placing any assets in the right paths. While this process is easy for small courses, it can
quickly get out of hands if you are generating courses with a lot of exercises or if you are
planning on creating a lot of courses.</p>
<p>For this reason, Trane provides utilities to help you write courses inside the <code>course_builder</code>
module in Trane. These utilities help you define the courses, lessons, and exercises as Rust code
and contain methods to generate all the files (including assets) while also performing several
sanity checks. While the decision of generating courses by writing Rust source files might seem
strange at first, it's actually a lot easier and less annoying than writing a course by hand.
Another advantage is that any breaking change to the manifest data structures in Trane will result
in a compile error, so you can be confident that your courses will work with a specific version of
Trane as long as the code compiles.</p>
<p>These utilities can be augmented to help you write more easily specific types of courses. For
example, inside the <code>course_builder</code> module, there is a <code>CirclesFifthCourse</code> struct that can be used
to generate courses that require a lesson for each key and which follow the order of the circles of
fifths, starting with the key of C and going clockwise and counterclockwise into each of the other
keys.</p>
<p>You can look at any of the <a href="./official_courses.html">official Trane courses</a> for example of how
courses are written.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="official-trane-courses"><a class="header" href="#official-trane-courses">Official Trane Courses</a></h1>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="contributing-to-trane"><a class="header" href="#contributing-to-trane">Contributing to Trane</a></h1>
<p>Trane is accepting contributions, specially for
<a href="https://github.com/trane-project/trane-music">trane-music</a>. Here's a list of ways to contribute:</p>
<h2 id="code-contributions"><a class="header" href="#code-contributions">Code contributions</a></h2>
<p>Trane and its associated projects are still in a very early stage, so I am not looking for code
contributions at this time. However, feel free to open an issue if you notice a bug or an issue with
my usage of Rust, since I am new to the language.</p>
<h2 id="suggesting-new-material-in-one-of-the-official-courses"><a class="header" href="#suggesting-new-material-in-one-of-the-official-courses">Suggesting new material in one of the official courses</a></h2>
<p>Easiest way to contribute is by simply opening an issue in the appropriate repo and suggesting new
courses or lessons to be added. It is especially useful to detail how the material in those units
relates to other material (either in existing courses or ones that have not been added yet) and how
you would break the material into smaller lessons, if it is necessary. Either links to reference
material or example exercises are also useful.</p>
<p>If you are a domain expert but can't (or want) to code any material yourself, this is a great way to
contribute as a large part of the task at hand is breaking down skills and knowledge into smaller
units and figuring a sensible order in which they should be introduced to students.</p>
<h2 id="planning-new-material"><a class="header" href="#planning-new-material">Planning new material</a></h2>
<p>This is a more involved version of the above. You still don't need to code any material yourself but
if you already know exactly how the material you want to add translates to courses, lessons, and
exercises, you can write them in a simplified format in plain text and propose the course is added
by opening and issue and sharing your work. Once all the details have been ironed out and your
proposal has been accepted, someone else can work into translating it into working code.</p>
<h2 id="coding-new-material"><a class="header" href="#coding-new-material">Coding new material</a></h2>
<p>You can also contribute by adding the code to generate new courses and lessons. The best way to
learn is to look at how existing courses are defined. You can either create courses for material you
have designed yourself or generate new material that has been proposed and approved but still needs
to be added as code. Make sure you have gotten an approval to work on new material before submitting
a PR.</p>
