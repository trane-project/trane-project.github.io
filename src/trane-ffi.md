# trane-ffi

[trane-ffi](https://github.com/trane-project/trane-ffi) provides implementations of Trane types in
other languages thanks to [typeshare](https://github.com/1Password/typeshare).

Implementations are available for Kotlin, Swift, and Typescript, which are the languages supported
by typeshare.

This project is useful for projects that want to make use of Trane but are written in a language
other than Rust.
