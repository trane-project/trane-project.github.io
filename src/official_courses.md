# Official Trane Courses

The Trane Project also aims to offer quality official courses to go along with the software. Here's
the list of all official courses.

- [trane-music](https://github.com/trane-project/trane-music/): Courses on music. Still under
  construction but a lot more courses are in the works.
- [trane-rustlings](https://github.com/trane-project/trane-rustlings): A course showcasing how Trane
  can be used to extend existing educational materials. This course augments
  [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings), a course to learn the Rust programming
  language.
