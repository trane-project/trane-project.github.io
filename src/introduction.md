Trane is an automated learning system for the acquisition of complex and highly hierarchical skills.
It is based on the principles of spaced repetition, mastery learning, and chunking.

Given a set of exercises which have been bundled into lessons and further bundled in courses, as
well as the dependency relationships between those lessons and courses, Trane selects exercises to
present to the user. It makes sure that exercises from a course or lesson are not presented until
the exercises in their dependencies have been sufficiently mastered. It also tries to keep the
difficulty of the exercises balanced, so that the selected exercises lie slightly outside the user's
current abilities.

You can think of this process as progressing through the skill tree of a character in a video game,
but applied to arbitrary skills, specified in plain-text files which are easy to share and augment.

Trane is named after John Coltrane, whose nickname Trane was often used in wordplay with the word
train (as in the vehicle) to describe the overwhelming power of his playing. It is used here as a
play on its homophone (as in "*trane* a new skill").
