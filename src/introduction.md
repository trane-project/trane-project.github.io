Trane is an automated practice system for the acquisition of arbitrary, complex, and highly
hierarchical skills. That's quite a mouthful, so let's break it down.

- **Practice system**: Deliberate practice is at the heart of the acquisition of new skills. Trane
  calls itself a practice system because it is designed to guide student's progress through
  arbitrary skills. Trane shows the student an exercise they can practice and then asks them to
  score it based on their mastery of the skill tested by the exercise.
- **Automated**: Knowing what to practice, when to reinforce what has already been practiced, and
  when to move on to the next step is as important as establishing a consistent practice. Trane's
  main feature is to automate this process by providing students with an infinite stream of
  exercises. Internally, Trane uses the student feedback to determine which exercises are most
  appropriate for the current moment.
- **Arbitrary**: Although originally envisioned for practicing Jazz improvisation, Trane is not
  limited to a specific domain. Trane primarily works via plain-text files that are easily sharable
  and extendable. This allows student to create their own materials, to use materials created by
  others, and to seamlessly combine them. 
- **Complex and hierarchical skills**: Consider the job of a master improviser, such as the namesake
  of this software, John Coltrane. Through years of practice, Coltrane developed mastery over a
  large set of interconnected skills. A few examples include the breathing control to play the fiery
  stream of notes that characterize his style, the aural training to recognize and play in any key,
  and the fine motor skills to play the intricate lines of his solos. All these skills came together
  to create his unique and spiritually powerful sound. Trane is designed to allow students to easily
  express these complex relationships and to take advantage of them to guide the student's practice.
  This is perhaps the feature that is at the core of Trane and the main differentiation between it
  and similar software, such as Anki, which already makes use of some the same learning principles,
  such as spaced repetition.

Trane is based multiple proven principles of skill acquisition, such as spaced repetition, mastery
learning, and chunking. For example, Trane makes sure that not too many very easy or hard exercises
are shown to a student to avoid both extremes of frustration and boredom. Trane makes sure to
periodically reinforce skills that have already been practiced and to include new skills
automatically when the skills that they depend on have been sufficiently mastered.

If you are familiar with the experience of traversing the skill tree of a video game by grinding and
becoming better at the game, Trane aims to provide a way to help students complete a similar
process, but applied to arbitrary skills, specified in plain-text files that are easy to share and
augment.

Trane is named after John Coltrane, whose nickname Trane was often used in wordplay with the word
train (as in the vehicle) to describe the overwhelming power of his playing. It is used here as a
play on its homophone (as in "*trane* a new skill").
