# Vision

Trane aims to offer a coherent and powerful user experience that is capable of taking students of
any level and allowing them to make the most out of their practice sessions, as well as offering
features to allow teachers to track and guide the progress of their students. Trane will attempt to
fulfil those goals by making progress along main four angles. Those are described below using
musical training as an example, but any skill for which the proper exercises and the dependencies
among them can be derived should be an apt candidate for Trane.

## Defining arbitrary skills graphs

Complex skills are in fact a complex network of simpler skills and domain knowledge that have been
acquired after many years of practice. Experts on a field might not be consciously aware of the full
network, either because some of it is the result of unconscious processes or because it was learned
in early childhood or in an unstructured manner.

Trane's first goal is to handle a large set of exercises as well as their dependencies in a way that
allows users to define arbitrary relationships between them, to seamlessly combine exercises from
multiple sources, and to provide primitives to select particular sections of the graph to focus on
or to ignore during practice sessions.

As an example, the skill of playing a large musical piece depends on the skills of playing each
movement, which in turn depend on skills to play each passage. By defining the practice of the piece
on this manner, the student is first asked to master individual passages, then individual movements,
and eventually the entire piece.

## Automated and guided progress

Having defined an extensive skill graph, students should be able to take advantage of it without
lots of effort or planning. In its default mode, Trane provides exercises to the user that gradually
introducing students to new skills and reinforcing the ones already in the process of being
mastered.
