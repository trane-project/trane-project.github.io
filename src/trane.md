# trane

[trane](https://github.com/trane-project/trane) is the core library responsible for opening and
interacting with Trane courses. It also includes the data formats for Trane and the utilities to
build new courses.

Other applications are free to integrate Trane in their own ways. For example, a fighting video game
could integrate Trane into their tutorial mode to allow players to efficiently practice their skills
and make automatic progress in mastering all the game's mechanics.

This library contains utilities to make it easier to write Trane courses. Refer to the section
[Writing Trane Courses](./writing_courses.md) for more information.
