# Licensing

All code in Trane is licensed under the GPLv3 license with the following exceptions:

- The `data` and `course_builder` modules in the `trane` library so that the data formats for Trane
  and the utilities to build can be shared using a less restrictive license.
- The upcoming `trane-server` project so that other projects that are incompatible with the GPLv3
  license can stil use Trane.
